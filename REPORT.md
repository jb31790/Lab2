# Report

Once again, I did not give myself enough time, however, im sure i wouldve finished every requirement for the 5th grade level if id started earlier.

Im handing in this on the 5th grade level in hopes that youll see that if i had just continued developing the form for creating quizzes and saving it to localstorage id have met those requirements.

Every page on the website is dynamically generated from items in localstorage, cookies, and json-files. This makes the website adaptable.

Ill briefly go through how id have met the grade 5 requirements, to show that i know how i wouldve done it if i had more time.

I currently have a page for creating qizzes, when you add data on that page (questions, metadata, etc.) that should be saved in a json-object. When you click "save", that json-object gets saved in local storage. An object holding the metadata for the quizzes also gets updated. When you then visit the quiz-selection-page, that page dynamically generates cards for every quiz, from the metadata-json in localstorage. Then you open your custom-quiz and that page renders your quiz from the quiz-json found in localstorage.

With 5 minutes to go, this will have to be the report i hand in. If you want to hear more you tell me and ill update this report in the git-repo and get back to you when thats done.
